# 001 Hello Java 

## What is this?

This is the first tutorial in the Java Compiling series and its intent is to teach you what is occurring when you compile and run `.java` files.

## Why make this?

Because you gotta start somewhere ;)

## How do I use this?

- Read the code (2 very simple java files)
- Look at the compile and run commands in the `run.sh <arg>` file.
    - Read the comments in this file to understand why some scenarios pass and others fail

## Notes on this exercise:

- We use two "unpackaged" (meaning no declared package) classes.
- Our `App` class has a "main" method making it an a runnable application.
- We do not explicitly compile the classes the App class is dependent upon; Java handles this for us.
