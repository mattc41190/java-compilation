# B Door Store

## What is this?

This is the fourth tutorial in the Java Compiling series and its intent is to teach you how jars are intended to work within the scope of the Java ecosystem.

## Why make this?

Because understanding JARs is essential to making non-trivial Java applications.

## How do I use this?

- Read the code
- Look at the compile and run commands in the `run.sh <arg>` file.
    - Read the comments in this file to understand why some scenarios pass and others fail

## Notes on this exercise:

- The code structure in this lesson follows a similar pattern to that laid out in the packages lesson. To better understand packages see that lesson.
- This JAR will depend on JARs written elsewhere see part A for dependency.
