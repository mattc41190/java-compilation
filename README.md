# Java Compilation

## What is this?

This is a tutorial style repo that is intended to reinforce lessons set out in the Java documentation.

## Why make this?

Because sometimes folks are slow and need help breaking down what is occurring when Java compiles (`javac`) and runs (`java`) a class or Jar.

Some of us like knowing the essence of what is occurring and find the generally accepted answer of "Ideally, you don't interact with `javac` directly anyway, but let your IDE and/or build system take care of that for you" distasteful and in truth a bit of a code smell that a language is so difficult to use that after market tools must be employed to create useful artifacts in it.

## How do I use this?

- Have Java 8+ installed
- Have a *nix box (I have a Mac)
