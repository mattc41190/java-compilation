# Java Compiling

## What is this?

This is a tutorial style repo that is intended to reinforce lessons set out in the Java documentation.

## Why make this?

Because sometimes folks are slow and need help breaking down what is occurring when Java compiles (`javac`) and runs (`java`) a class or Jar.
